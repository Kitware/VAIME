KWIVER v1.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous
v1.5.0 release.

Bug Fixes since v1.5.0
----------------------

Arrows: Core

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   principal point was not initialized from the image size unless there
   was also metadata useful for determining focal length.  Distortion
   parameters were also not properly preserved in this initialization
   and this has also been resolved.

Arrows: CUDA

 * Fixed a bug in launching the integrate_depth_maps CUDA kernel.
   Previously, the kernel would fail to launch if the size of the volume
   along the X direction was greater than 1024.

 * Added a max_voxels_per_launch configuration option to the CUDA
   integrate_depth_maps algorithm.  This works around a CUDA limitation
   in which long-running CUDA kernels cause the GPU to freeze the system.
   On Windows this leads to a time out after 2 seconds and the application
   is terminated.  To avoid this we now launch the kernel multiple times
   covering a subset of voxels in each chunk.
