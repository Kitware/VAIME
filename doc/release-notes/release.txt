KWIVER v1.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous
v1.5.0 release.

Bug Fixes since v1.5.0
----------------------

Arrows: Core

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   principal point was not initialized from the image size unless there
   was also metadata useful for determining focal length.  Distortion
   parameters were also not properly preserved in this initialization
   and this has also been resolved.

Arrows: OpenCV

 * Fixed improper use of RANSAC in the OpenCV estimate_pnp algorithm.
   This algorithm was producing a lower then expected success rate when
   resectioning cameras.
