VIAME is a computer vision library designed to integrate several image and video processing algorithms together in
a common distributed processing framework, majorly targeting marine species analytics. As it contains many common
algorithms and compiles several other popular repositories together as a part of its build process, VIAME is also
useful as a general computer vision toolkit. The core infrastructure connecting different system components is
currently the KWIVER library, which can connect C/C++, python, and matlab nodes together in a graph-like pipeline
architecture. Alongside the pipelined image processing system are a number of standalone utilties for model training,
output detection visualization, groundtruth annotation, detector/tracker evaluation (a.k.a. scoring), image/video search,
and rapid model generation.

Quick Run Instructions
----------------------

If building from the source, all final compiled binaries are placed in the
[build-directory]/install directory, which is the same as the root directory
in the above pre-built binaries. This will hereby be refered to as the [install-directory].

One way to test the system is to see if you can run the examples in the
[[install-directory]/examples](https://github.com/Kitware/VIAME/tree/master/examples)
folder, for example, the pipelined object detectors or annotation GUI. If pursuing this route, we
recommend reading the: 
[Examples Overview](https://viame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section_links/example_capabilities.html), 
[Annotation Overview](https://viame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section_links/annotation_and_visualization.html), 
[Deep Model Generation Overview](https://viame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section_links/object_detector_training.html), and
[Rapid Model Generation Overview](https://viame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section_links/search_and_rapid_model_generation.html#video-and-image-search-using-viame).

The 'examples' folder is one of two core entry points into running VIAME functionality. The other is
to copy project files for your operating system,
[[install-directory]/configs/prj-linux](https://github.com/Kitware/VIAME/tree/master/configs/prj-linux) or
[[install-directory]/configs/prj-windows](https://github.com/Kitware/VIAME/tree/master/configs/prj-windows)
to a directory of your choice and run things from there. Not all functionality is in the default project
file scripts, however, but it is a good entry point if you just want to get started on training object
detection and/or tracking models. There are some environment variables in these files that need to
be set up before you can run on any OS, which are all in the [install-directory]/setup_viame.sh/.bat script.
This script is sourced in all of the project scripts, so there is no need to modify anything unless you
installed VIAME to a non-default location. For the later case you will need to need to modify the
VIAME_INSTALL path at the top of each run script to point to your installed location. 


Quick Build Instructions
------------------------

More in-depth build instructions can be found [here](examples/building_and_installing_viame), but
VIAME itself can be built either as a super-build, which builds most of its
dependencies alongside itself, or standalone. To build VIAME requires, at a minimum,
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and a C++ compiler.
If using the command line, run the following commands, only replacing [source-directory] and
[build-directory] with locations of your choice:

	git clone https://github.com/Kitware/VIAME.git [source-directory]

	cd [source-directory] && git submodule update --init --recursive

Next, create a build directory and run the following `cmake` command (or alternatively
use the cmake GUI if you are not using the command line interface):

	mkdir [build-directory] && cd [build-directory]

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release [source-directory]

Once your `cmake` command has completed, you can configure any build flags you want
using 'ccmake' or the cmake GUI, and then build with the following command on Linux:

	make -j8

Or alternatively by building it in Visual Studio or your compiler of choice on
Windows. The '-j8' tells the build to run multi-threaded using 8 threads, this is
useful for a faster build though if you get an error it can be difficult to know
here it was, in which case running just 'make' might be more helpful. For Windows,
currently VS2015 and VS2017 are supported. If using CUDA,
version 8.0 or 9.0, with CUDNN 6.0 is desired. Other versions have yet to be tested
extensively. On Windows it can also be beneficial to use Anaconda to get multiple
python packages. Boost Python (turned on by default when Python is enabled) requires
Numpy and a few other dependencies.

There are several optional arguments to viame which control which plugins get built,
such as those listed below. If a plugin is enabled that depends on another dependency
such as OpenCV) then the dependency flag will be forced to on.

And a number of flags which control which system utilities and optimizations are built, e.g.:


<center>

| Flag                         | Description                                                                                 |

</center>

Update Instructions
-------------------

If you already have a checkout of VIAME and want to switch branches or
update your code, it is important to re-run:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

After switching branches to ensure that you have on the correct hashes
of sub-packages within the build. Very rarely you may also need to run:

	git submodule sync

Just in case the address of submodules has changed. You only need to
run this command if you get a "cannot fetch hash #hashid" error.
