VIAME is a computer vision application designed for do-it-yourself artificial intelligence including
object detection, object tracking, image/video annotation, image/video search, image mosaicing,
size measurement, rapid model generation, and tools for the evaluation of different algorithms.
Originally targetting marine species analytics, it now contains many common algorithms and libraries,
and is also useful as a generic computer vision toolkit. It contains a number of standalone tools for
accomplishing the above, a pipeline framework which can connect C/C++, python, and matlab nodes together
in a multi-threaded fashion, and, lastly, multiple algorithms resting on top of the pipeline infrastructure.
Both a desktop and web version exist for deployments in different types of environments.

Installations
-------------

For a full installation guide and description of the various flavors of VIAME, see the
quick-start guide, above. In summary, VIAME Desktop is currently provided as either a .zip or
.tar file. Alternatively, docker files are available for both VIAME Desktop and Web (below).
A sample instance of VIAME Web is also online, hosted at [viame.kitware.com](https://viame.kitware.com).
For desktop installs, extract the binaries and place them in a directory of your choosing,
for example /opt/noaa/viame on Linux or C:\Program Files\VIAME on Windows. If you're using
packages built with GPU support, make sure to have sufficient video drivers installed,
version 451.82 or higher. The best way to install drivers depends on your operating system,
see below. Lastly, run through some of the examples to validate the installation. The binaries
are quite large, in terms of disk space, due to the inclusion of multiple default model files
and programs, but if just building your desired features from source (e.g. for embedded apps)
they are much smaller.

Note: To install Add-Ons and Patches, copy them into an existing VIAME installation folder.
To use project files extract them into your working directory of choice. Custom distributions 
contain a full installation, only with non-default features turned on, and should not be copied
into existing installations because they are a full installation and bad things will happen.

Docker Images
-------------

Docker images are available on: https://hub.docker.com. For a default container with just core
algorithms, runnable via command-line, see:

kitware/viame:gpu-algorithms-latest

This image is headless (ie, it contains no GUI) and contains a VIAME desktop (not web)
installation in the folder /opt/noaa/viame. For links to the VIAME-Web docker containers see the
above section in the installation documentation. Most add-on models are not included in the
instance but can be downloaded via running the script download_viame_addons.sh in the bin folder.

Quick Build Instructions
------------------------

These instructions are intended for developers or those interested in building the latest master
branch. More in-depth build instructions can be found [here](examples/building_and_installing_viame),
but the software can be built either as a super-build, which builds most of its dependencies
alongside itself, or standalone. To build VIAME requires, at a minimum, [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[CMake](https://cmake.org/), and a [C++ compiler](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/).
Installing Python and CUDA is also recommended. If using CUDA, version 10.1 or 9.2 are preferred,
with CUDNN 7.0 (not 8.0, yet). Other CUDA versions may or may not work. On both Windows and Linux it
is also highly recommended to use [Anaconda3 5.2.0](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) for python,
which is the most tested distribution used by developers. If using other python distributions
having numpy installed, at a minimum, is necessary and there some issues on certain versions with
the plugin system used on different version to be fixed on future versions.

To build on the command line in Linux, use the following commands, only replacing [source-directory]
and [build-directory] with locations of your choice. While these directories can be the same,
it's good practice to have a 'src' checkout then a seperate 'build' directory alongside it:

	git clone https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME.git [source-directory]

	cd [source-directory] && git submodule update --init --recursive

Next, create a build directory and run the following `cmake` command (or alternatively
use the cmake GUI if you are not using the command line interface):

	mkdir [build-directory] && cd [build-directory]

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release [source-directory]

Once your `cmake` command has completed, you can configure any build flags you want
using 'ccmake' or the cmake GUI, and then build with the following command on Linux:

	make -j8

Or alternatively by building it in Visual Studio or your compiler of choice on
Windows. On Linux, '-j8' tells the build to run multi-threaded using 8 threads, this
is useful for a faster build though if you get an error it can be difficult to see
it, in which case running just 'make' might be more helpful. For Windows,
currently VS2017 is the desired compiler, though select versions of 2015 and 2019
also work.

There are several optional arguments to viame which control which plugins get built,
such as those listed below. If a plugin is enabled that depends on another dependency
such as OpenCV) then the dependency flag will be forced to on. If uncertain what to turn
on, it's best to just leave the default enable and disable flags which will build most
(though not all) functionalities. These are core components we recommend leaving turned on:


<center>

| Flag                         | Description                                                                        |

| VIAME_DOWNLOAD_MODELS        | Downloads pre-trained models for use with the examples and interfaces              |

Update Instructions
-------------------

If you already have a checkout of VIAME and want to switch branches or
update your code, it is important to re-run:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

After switching branches to ensure that you have on the correct hashes
of sub-packages within the build. Very rarely you may also need to run:

	git submodule sync

Just in case the address of submodules has changed. You only need to
run this command if you get a "cannot fetch hash #hashid" error.
