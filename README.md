VIAME is a computer vision library designed to integrate several image and video processing algorithms together in
a common distributed processing framework, majorly targeting marine species analytics. As it contains many common
algorithms and compiles several other popular repositories together as a part of its build process, VIAME is also
useful as a general computer vision toolkit. The core infrastructure connecting different system components is
currently the KWIVER library, which can connect C/C++, python, and matlab nodes together in a graph-like pipeline
architecture. Alongside the pipelined image processing system are a number of standalone utilties for model training,
output visualization, groundtruth annotation, detector/tracker evaluation (a.k.a. scoring), image/video search,
and rapid model generation.

Pre-Built Binaries
------------------

For a full installation guide see the quick-start slide deck above, but in summary, first install Anaconda.
Secondly, extract the binaries and place them in a directory of your choosing, for example C:\Program Files\VIAME
on Windows or /opt/noaa/viame on Linux. Next, if Anaconda was installed to a non-default location, set the
PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR at the top of the setup_viame.sh (Linux) or setup_viame.bat (Windows) script in the root
install folder to point to the location of your installed Anaconda distribution. Lastly, run through some of
the examples to validate the installation.

Quick Build Instructions
------------------------

These instructions are intended for developers or those interested in building the latest
master branch. More in-depth build instructions can be found [here](examples/building_and_installing_viame),
but VIAME itself can be built either as a super-build, which builds most of its
dependencies alongside itself, or standalone. To build VIAME requires, at a minimum,
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and a C++ compiler.
If using the command line, run the following commands, only replacing [source-directory] and
[build-directory] with locations of your choice:

	git clone https://github.com/Kitware/VIAME.git [source-directory]

	cd [source-directory] && git submodule update --init --recursive

Next, create a build directory and run the following `cmake` command (or alternatively
use the cmake GUI if you are not using the command line interface):

	mkdir [build-directory] && cd [build-directory]

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release [source-directory]

Once your `cmake` command has completed, you can configure any build flags you want
using 'ccmake' or the cmake GUI, and then build with the following command on Linux:

	make -j8

Or alternatively by building it in Visual Studio or your compiler of choice on
Windows. The '-j8' tells the build to run multi-threaded using 8 threads, this is
useful for a faster build though if you get an error it can be difficult to know
here it was, in which case running just 'make' might be more helpful. For Windows,
currently VS2015 (with only some sub-versions of 2017) are supported. If using CUDA,
version 9.0 and above, with CUDNN 7.0 and above is desired. On Windows it can also be
beneficial to use Anaconda to get multiple python packages. Boost Python (turned on by
default when Python is enabled) requires Numpy and a few other dependencies.

There are several optional arguments to viame which control which plugins get built,
such as those listed below. If a plugin is enabled that depends on another dependency
such as OpenCV) then the dependency flag will be forced to on. If uncertain what to turn
on, it's best to just leave the default enable and disable flags which will build most
(though not all) functionalities.

</center>

Update Instructions
-------------------

If you already have a checkout of VIAME and want to switch branches or
update your code, it is important to re-run:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

After switching branches to ensure that you have on the correct hashes
of sub-packages within the build. Very rarely you may also need to run:

	git submodule sync

Just in case the address of submodules has changed. You only need to
run this command if you get a "cannot fetch hash #hashid" error.
